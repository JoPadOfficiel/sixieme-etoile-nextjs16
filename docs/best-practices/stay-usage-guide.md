## When to Use STAY vs Separate Quotes

### Use STAY When:

✅ **Same Client, Multiple Days**

- Corporate events spanning 2-5 days
- Tourist packages with multiple services
- Business travel with recurring needs
- VIP delegations requiring comprehensive service

✅ **Package Pricing Desired**

- Client wants single quote for entire stay
- Negotiated package discount applies
- Simplified billing preferred
- Marketing as complete travel solution

✅ **Operational Coherence**

- Same vehicle/driver throughout stay
- Coordinated staffing (hotels, meals)
- Consistent service quality
- Simplified logistics management

✅ **Complex Multi-Service Days**

- Days with multiple transfers + excursions
- Mixed service types (transfer, dispo, excursion)
- Interconnected services requiring coordination
- Timeline optimization across services

### Use Separate Quotes When:

❌ **Independent Services**

- Unrelated trips for same client
- Different passengers each time
- No package discount applicable
- Services weeks apart

❌ **Separate Billing Required**

- Different cost centers per service
- Individual invoice per trip needed
- Separate payment terms
- Different clients (even if coordinated)

❌ **Maximum Flexibility Needed**

- High cancellation risk per service
- Uncertain schedule
- Client may modify individual services
- Separate approval processes

❌ **Different Service Levels**

- Mix of economy and premium services
- Different vehicle categories needed
- Varying service standards
- Separate SLAs per service

## Pricing Optimization Strategies

### 1. Minimize Empty Segments

**Strategy:** Group services to reduce deadhead distance

**Example:**

```
❌ Poor Planning:
Day 1: CDG → Paris Hotel (return to base)
Day 2: Base → Paris Hotel → Versailles → Paris Hotel (return to base)
Day 3: Base → Paris Hotel → CDG
Total empty km: 120 km

✅ Optimized:
Day 1: CDG → Paris Hotel (vehicle stays in Paris)
Day 2: Paris Hotel → Versailles → Paris Hotel (vehicle stays)
Day 3: Paris Hotel → CDG (return to base)
Total empty km: 40 km
Savings: 80 km × 2.50€ = 200€
```

### 2. Optimize Overnight Stays

**Strategy:** Plan service end times to avoid unnecessary hotel nights

**Example:**

```
❌ Expensive:
Service ends at 20:30 → Hotel required (85€)

✅ Optimized:
Service ends at 19:45 → No hotel needed
Savings: 85€ per driver
```

**Techniques:**

- Schedule last service to end before 20:00
- Combine evening services to justify hotel
- Plan early morning starts to use overnight positioning

### 3. Meal Cost Management

**Strategy:** Optimize service duration to minimize meal counts

**Example:**

```
❌ Expensive:
Service: 9:00-16:00 (7h) → 2 meals (lunch + dinner counted)

✅ Optimized:
Service: 9:00-15:30 (6.5h) → 1 meal (lunch only)
Savings: 25€ per driver
```

**Techniques:**

- Break long services into shorter segments
- Provide meal allowance instead of full meal cost
- Negotiate meal packages with hotels

### 4. Single Driver vs Double Crew

**Strategy:** Optimize staffing to meet RSE while minimizing costs

**Decision Matrix:**

```
Duration < 10h, Distance < 400km → Single driver
Duration 10-13h, Distance 400-500km → Single driver with breaks
Duration > 13h OR Distance > 500km → Double crew required

Cost Impact:
Single driver: 0€ additional
Double crew: ~200-300€ per day
```

**Optimization:**

- Split very long days into two shorter days
- Use relay drivers at strategic points
- Plan overnight stops to reset RSE counters

---

## Service Composition Best Practices

### Daily Service Mix

**Balanced Day Example:**

```
Day 1: Arrival
- Morning: Airport transfer (1h)
- Afternoon: City orientation tour (3h)
- Evening: Restaurant transfer (30min)
Total: 4.5h → Manageable, profitable

Day 2: Full Day
- Morning: Excursion departure (8:00)
- Day: Full-day excursion with stops (8h)
- Evening: Return to hotel (18:00)
Total: 10h → Efficient use of resources

Day 3: Departure
- Morning: Hotel → Airport (1h)
Total: 1h → Quick, profitable
```

### Service Timing

**Best Practices:**

- **Morning transfers**: 8:00-10:00 (avoid rush hour)
- **Excursions**: Start 9:00-10:00 (full day utilization)
- **Evening services**: End before 20:00 (avoid hotel costs)
- **Availability**: 4-6 hour blocks (optimal pricing)

### Waypoint Management

**For Excursions:**

```
✅ Good Waypoint Planning:
- 3-5 stops maximum per excursion
- 30-60 min per stop (cultural sites)
- 15-30 min per stop (photo opportunities)
- Logical geographic routing

❌ Poor Planning:
- 10+ stops (rushed, stressful)
- Backtracking routes (inefficient)
- Unrealistic stop durations
- No buffer time
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Underestimating Duration

❌ **Mistake:**

```
Versailles excursion: 4 hours estimated
Reality: 6 hours (traffic + longer visit)
Result: Rushed client, overtime costs
```

✅ **Solution:**

- Add 20% buffer to all estimates
- Research actual visit durations
- Account for traffic patterns
- Include meal/rest breaks

### 2. Ignoring Staffing Costs

❌ **Mistake:**

```
Quote: 800€ (base price only)
Actual cost: 800€ + 170€ hotel + 100€ meals = 1,070€
Result: Negative margin
```

✅ **Solution:**

- Always include staffing in quotes
- Use automatic calculation
- Verify hotel/meal requirements
- Add contingency for unexpected nights

### 3. Poor Service Sequencing

❌ **Mistake:**

```
Day 1: Full-day excursion (10h)
Day 2: Airport transfer (1h)
Day 3: City tour (4h)
Result: Inefficient resource use
```

✅ **Solution:**

```
Day 1: Airport transfer + city orientation (4h)
Day 2: Full-day excursion (10h)
Day 3: Morning tour + airport transfer (5h)
Result: Balanced daily utilization
```

### 4. Inflexible Pricing

❌ **Mistake:**

- Fixed price, no modifications allowed
- Client wants to add service → must create new quote
- Lost upsell opportunity

✅ **Solution:**

- Build flexibility into package
- Offer optional add-ons
- Clear pricing for modifications
- Easy amendment process
